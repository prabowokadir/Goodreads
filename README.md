# Goodreads

This is a project that I created when I first started studying Data Science in July 2019. This project is my final result from Big Data Analytics Training that was held by Digital Talent Scholarship - Ministry of Communication and Informatic.

The project I'm trying to work on is crawling data from the Goodreads-Best Books of the Decade: 2010s (2010-2019) website. Apart from that, I also did some simple analysis with the data.
